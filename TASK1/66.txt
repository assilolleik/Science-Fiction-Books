"The red planet beyond the earth is Mars, who appears in the sky as a
ruddy gold or coppery star. He is 141 million miles from the sun,
travels his orbit in 687 days, and wheels round his axis in 24 hours 37
minutes. His diameter is 4,200 miles, and his mass about one-ninth that
of the earth. A body weighing two pounds on the earth would only make
half a pound on Mars. As you know, his atmosphere is clear and thin, his
surface is flat, and it is subject to floods from the melting of the polar snows.
