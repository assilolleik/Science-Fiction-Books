"A long time ago. Six, maybe seven-thousand years or so, we seeded
lightly just to see what would happen. Earth was shaping up nicely as a
matriarchal society – until all the invasions and cross-breedings took
place. The Huns and Mongols invaded westward towards Europe and
conquered them – or killed them as witches.
Then the Inquisition and witch trials pretty much finished
them off until no one was left but those few practitioners who have no
idea of their heritage and whose skills are very meager. Sadly, most of
them have no idea at all of what to do with them."
