The one visible feature in the structure was a single door â€“ actually a slab of metal that was about the size and shape of a door for a human and set at ground level, but without doorknob, door knocker or doorbell. The space behind it was hollow, as near as they could tell. They knocked on the door. No response. They pounded on it. Nothing. The expedition had a hammer. This was fetched over exactly what constituted an aggressive act, it was used to bash the door. The hammer left no mark but made the metal ring like a gong.
