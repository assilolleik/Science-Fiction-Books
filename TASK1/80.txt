I could see the pallor of death creeping steadily into the last corners
of his lips, and I knew that the end was not far away. Suddenly a black
frustration built up within me. "What are you waiting for?" I screamed,
the tenseness, and the importance of this moment forcing me to lose the
iron self-control upon which I have always prided myself. I knew that
the answer held the secret of what I must know. If I could learn that,
my experiment would not be in vain, and I could make whatever
preparations were necessary for my own death.
