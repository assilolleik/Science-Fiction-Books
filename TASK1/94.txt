It had taken a whole moon to cross from east to west, from their camp in
the Trembling Lands to this place where the Bad Axe River emptied into
the Great River. The land through which they passed, following an old
Winnebago trail, was rolling prairie at first. Then they plunged into
country that was ever wilder and more mountainous as they struggled
westward. At the last they had to cut their own trail. They marked their
passage with kettles, blankets, tent poles and other strong possessions too
heavy to carry, and their dying old people who no more walk.
