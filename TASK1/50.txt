It took some seven days but a deal was eventually struck with the New Eurons.
The list of people of interest to the New Eurons was pared down to a mere five
hundred. Real criminals seemed to be exempt of any worry to the delight of people
like our Moose. It was select professionals, academics and politicos that were
being put under the microscope. At any rate, any marcher â€“ migrant or otherwise
was going to have their paperwork in order to pass this newly constructed New
Euron checkpoint in the future.
It took another full day to process our group.
