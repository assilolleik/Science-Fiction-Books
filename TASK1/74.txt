I thought it a strange fact that modern sailors, armed with all the
resources of science and with the experience of numerous Arctic
voyages to guide them, could get only three degrees nearer the pole
than Henry Hudson did nearly three hundred years ago. That redoubtable
seaman possessed neither the ships nor men of later voyagers nor the
many appliances of his successors to mitigate the intense cold, yet
his record in view of the facts of the case remains triumphant.
It was at this time that my father died. He left me the bulk of his very own property.
