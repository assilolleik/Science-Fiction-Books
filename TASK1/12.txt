Healers and Seniors of four races sat around the conference room
table this morning; reviewing their notes regarding Jaiying. Each of them
had specific strengths and weaknesses, and they’d spent the last several
days working with the Vanir engineers to understand the stasis process,
and learning about what they could and could not do while the stasis
field was active. Commander Woldron was there with his set of notes
regarding test animals he’d subjected to stasis and recovered successfully
– he believed – while Lady Huan had her own reports of what limited
effects Healing efforts afforded living tissue while in stasis.
