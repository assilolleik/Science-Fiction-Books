Jenna had been a little girl. She lived in a wood, near a beach, by the ocean. She lived with
her grandfather, who had been the most magical person she had ever known. He had been old
when she was born and he got older while she grew, but he never looked bad. Wrinkles didn’t
make him ugly or make his eyes less bright. Even when he lay dead in front of her, he
still didn’t look faded or tired. Even his dead body was completely lovable to her.
Her memories of him were like polished brass, beautiful and clear.
