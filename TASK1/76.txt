In a distant part of the temple, on a terrelium pedestal, I again saw
a monster of gold, with a head and outstretched wings.
As I surveyed this stupendous figure, I discovered that it held in
its fore paws an immense helix of terrelium wire, ten feet in length
and nine feet in diameter. One end of the wire was joined to
thousand wires, whose extremities, terminating in wands,
were held by the twin-souls. Each priest held a wand in his
hand, and each priestess a wand in her left, and their disengaged arms
were wound around one another's waists.
