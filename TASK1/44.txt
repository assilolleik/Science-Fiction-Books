Larl was finishing giving David the poor man’s guide to the galaxy by
marking star systems inside the Commonwealth, their usual jump
paths, and some key points of interest, but David was looking decidedly
shakier than when they’d started. The sight of the vast Death Void
surrounding them had been a shock to both of them, but David wasn’t
handling it very well. Larl thought a distraction might be in order.
When he shifted the screen back to a raw view of the outside, David
was amazed at the detail that could be seen with the eye and
said so.
