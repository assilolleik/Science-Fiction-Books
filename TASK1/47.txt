travelers, a new bulkhead to separate the front section of the ship from
the new rear berthing areas, a "real" kitchen with sink, dishwasher,
food heaters (both radiant and microwave), and expanded cold food
storage. That was in addition to the existing "crew sustenance system"
that would pump out a tasteless nourishing gruel almost indefinitely,
so long as there was water and powdered nutrients to feed it.
The back berthing areas had been created to accommodate twelve
roomy bunks split between two compartments, a very cozy
almost dual-shower.
