And there in that aged music shop they stood so enthralled-music filled
their souls. It was exactly what they had needed and wanted for a lot of
years. And it had been denied them. Music was the most balancing force,
the force that would help them struggle ahead rebuilding the world. And
next time they would be saner they knew, the lesson of luxury had
been learned and learned well. Never again would they leave all of the
work to the machines. Now they would work and sing and play.
It would be work, very hard work, for some time.
