It was devastation and people were acting predictably; some were distraught,
some were focused on the wounded and caring for those who were most affected
by the attack. But again, someone had to take charge or we were all going to freeze
to death over night or starve to death in about two weeks time. I took Peg with me
and we looked for Karl. Karl was the last acting mayor and had retired from his
duties of running the colony some two years earlier; he was sixty-five years old
and once he left the mayorâ€™s post he moved forward.
