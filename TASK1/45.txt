"I think they may have been sent here, not to kill you, but to take control of your crowns. I
had Misha put the box of crowns in a locker under this bed earlier this afternoon. And now I
have to admit the other thing. This was never a therapy bed. It’s a pod, meant to give you an
escape route, something terrible has happened. I think
the soldiers went after Vash first because they thought he posed the threat. They would
want to immobilize your staff before coming in here. Now I’m going to drop you through the
floor."
