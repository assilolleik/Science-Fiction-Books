It was dark behind the altar-hut. The mad stampede of the Picts had not
carried them in that direction. At the wall Conan halted, gripped
Balthus and heaved him at arm's length into the air as he might have
lifted a child. Balthus grasped the points of the upright logs set in
the sun-dried mud and scrambled up on them, ignoring the havoc done his
skin. He lowered a hand to the Cimmerian, when around a corner of the
altar-hut sprang a fleeing Pict. He halted short, glimpsing the man on
the wall in the faint glow of the fires.
