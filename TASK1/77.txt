Well Liz this I got to see and Charlie says the same, but
 the letter says too Terran Authority will not give a permit
 to visit Earth just for this, so I wangled on to a
 Delegation which is coming to discuss trade with the
 Department of Commerce. Charlie and I will be arriving on
 Earth on August 24th.
 Liz it is good to think I shall be seeing you again after
 four years. There are some things about your future I meant
 to write to Professor M'Clare about, but now I shall be able
 to talk it over direct.
