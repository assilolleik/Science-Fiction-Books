The chain fence around number 37 was untouched, a tire leaning against its gate. The closest anyone dared come. From a tiny half-frosted window in the door, Kurt saw the thing pause at the end of the walkway. He swallowed, adjusted his view to see better.
It was staring right at him. It rolled the tire away, carefully leaning it against the fence post, and unlatched the gate. Halfway up the interlocked stone path, the thing stopped, turned, stared at the cross in the lawn. Nothing moved for some time, and Kurt gripped the trim round with bloodied fingernails, waiting.
