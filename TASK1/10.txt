Rodak-3 was hot and nasty. Normally, one would expect that its
orbital position would have made it uninhabitable at all, but when you
factored in two missing planets – as evidenced by the shattered rings of
asteroids orbiting both closer in and further out than Rodak-3 – there
was a strong suspicion that something bad had happened in the distant
past that had pushed its orbit into slightly more forgiving position.
Even then, it still wasn’t a place where you’d want to vacation, let alone
try to live on, though.
The colonists were certainly surprised when they’d arrived this far
into Blight.
