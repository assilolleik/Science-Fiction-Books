A few minutes later I was at the pump site. Its shelter had taken a solid hit or
two from some incoming. There was what we called sprock and then there was
spebbles. Anything larger than those two was salvage debris and they were
considerably larger pieces that often made craters on impact. The damage here was
done by sprock; part glass, part iron by the looks of the fragments from this one.
I can fix up the roof with some high density. To me she just overheated a bit from a clogged
blower and went out on thermal overload.
