The nightmare of the self: whatever you discover, it will never actually allow you to say anything about the foundation of things. Each discovery will only open up another scale, which, probed, will almost begin to imply a further scale, a finer-grained space. The small always has something smaller inside it. Whatever you find isn't the end, it’s only ever the beginning of something else. Worse, the characteristic of these successive foundational states is that they’re composed increasingly of emptiness, of the gaps between things. And the tools you develop operate only at the scale for which you develop them.
