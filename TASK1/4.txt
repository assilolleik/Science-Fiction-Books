Destiny hadn’t been all that surprised at the outcome. It was pretty
much a given, when Caldar deliberately dropped his guard and let the
woman take his head. He was still curious, of course, if the foolish man’s
backup plan would hold true, but since now he was out of play, the Fate
was released from her involuntarily frozen pose.
"No … no … why did he do that?" the Fainting Fate whispered.
"Stupidity… Hubris… I’m curious to see if he continues down this path"
He paused when the Fainting Fate turned to him with an expression of
shock on her face.
