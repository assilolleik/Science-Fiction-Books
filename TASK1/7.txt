Jenna knew all about dreams. If she dreamed of someone who was dead, she had to hide
that she knew they were dead. She had to act like it was a normal day. She wasn’t really in a
dream. She was really there. Her grandfather was walking into the water and he was laughing at
how cold the water was, but he didn’t say anything. Jenna had trained herself to never
speak to him in a dream. If she said nothing, if she just looked at him, she could look at him
longer. For that moment, she was with him.
