Ronnie had been held on board ship in his own ‘EMTU’ in a guarded
storeroom until Sally and Samuel had become available – partly as
representatives of the Prime, but mostly as technical advisors regarding
the stasis boxes. This was so specific details about the stasis boxes could
be explained to Commander Woldron and Lady Huan, before he was
transferred to a secure compartment on board the Microcosmus. They
needed time to come up with a suitable treatment plan, something made
extremely cumbersome by Ronnie’s decision to take things into his own
hands and end his life earlier than it expected.
