Like you, they possessed the _abasa_, but instead of living peacefully
they set out to conquer all the worlds and the Galaxies. In the end
they were defeated by your people who had some mysterious weapon that
penetrated every defense of the Sirenians. We came to your ancient
world to find a clue to that weapon because one of the Sirenians
succeeded in surviving and is now at large upon our own world. He
has seized control over our people and is setting out to sweep the
Galaxies with conquest and blood. In time he will find even your
world.
