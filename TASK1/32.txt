The bigger problem was all that damn powder stuck in his brain.
Where the powder concentrated, it had effectively blocked the Kantite
self-regulation and repair abilities that would normally keep Ronnie from
aging as rapidly as a standard Earth human. Under the current
circumstances, heâ€™d been aging at an accelerated rate that seemed
determined to bring him to his biological age of nearly two and a quarter
centuries. That was old, even for a native Kantite. For a half-breed like
Ronnie, it was certain death.
The argument could be made that, once cured, the First Lord could
spend some time.
