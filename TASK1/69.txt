I listened for the sound of their voices, but not a murmur passed
through the curtain which I drawn across the entrance to the smoking
cabin. Only a peculiar tremor from the mysterious engines broke the
utter stillness. Was I growing deaf? I snapped my fingers to reassure
myself, and the sound startled me like the crack of a pistol. Evidently
my sense of hearing had become abnormally acute. My mind, too, was
preternaturally clear, and the solitude became so irksome that I rose
from my seat, and looked out of the scuttles to relieve the tension of
my nerves.
