"He was afraid he would die. He thought if he confided in me, someone would hear him
talking and it would hasten his death."
Jenna huffed. "He did die, didn’t he?"
"Yes," Sardius confirmed. "His name was Arvantis. He tried to use me as little as possible
before the assassinations started. He didn’t want to have an octopus in his brain.
He took me out every time he got the chance. He wouldn’t sleep with me inside his ear, and my
home was not inside a pearl then. It was inside malachite. Jisbet has the same model in
Armen’s ear."
