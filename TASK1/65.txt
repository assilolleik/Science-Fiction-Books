Still, it is amusing to see these tarry fellows, even in this modern
day, take their last farewell of the harbour town. The ship is stowed,
and all ready for sea, and they wash and put on all their bravery of
attire. Ashore they go, their faces long with piety, and seek some
obscure temple whose God has little flavour with shore folk, and here
they make sacrifice with clamour and lavish outlay. And, finally, there
follows a feast in honour of the majestic God, and they arrive back on board, and
put to sea for the most part drunken.
