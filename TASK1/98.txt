A blue flash flared across the control board, momentarily blinding him.
Jonner recoiled, only his webbed safety belt preventing him from
plummeting from the control chair.
He swung back anxiously to the dials, brushing futilely at the spots
that swam before his eyes. He breathed a sigh of relief. The radio
controls had operated. The atomic engines had ceased firing.
Tentatively, cautiously, he reversed the lever. There was no blue flash
this time, but neither did the dials quiver. He swore. Something had
burned out in the radio controls. He couldn't reverse the tug.
He punched the general alarm button.
