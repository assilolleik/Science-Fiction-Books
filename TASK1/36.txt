I remember those words like they were yesterday. Taffy was two years younger at the time and I was as new and green as they come. I recall being quite apprehensive, shy, and quite uncomfortable about my appointment back then. There were surely many better qualified candidates for the apprenticeship out there I thought, but I, however had a history. And I’ve not met my mother. It would have been nice had I, but many people have no mother technically speaking. Just consider the New Eurons, they come directly from a butcher. They’re spat from a machine like cookie dough.
