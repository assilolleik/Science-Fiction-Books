Dorning shook his head and stood up. "No, I don’t. All I see is the
shower, which I need to use right now. Then I’m going shopping for some
much-needed groceries. The best thing you could do is organize your files
so you can get back to work and finish that important paper. Sorry about
the mess, Professor. If it’s any consolation, I need to reorganize my own
research papers, too. I didn’t want to leave them behind where they might
be found." He nodded to the other dresser in the room, which had a more
modest stack of books.
