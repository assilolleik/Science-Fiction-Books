"In Sardius’ case, it’s because he’s a very intelligent criminal. He’s a revolutionary, a terrorist,
a pirate, a mass murderer, an arsonist, and anything else. He has no limits to
what he can do. Frankly, when you go over his credentials, you don’t know if he’s a criminal
because if he was working as an army officer during the mayhem, he’d be
considered a hero. Already you know what he’s like when you talk to him. He’s charming, resourceful, entertaining, and calming when things are going very badly.
However, from our perspective, he feels problematic because we didn’t scout him."
