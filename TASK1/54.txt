The release was, he asserts, instantaneous. “At one moment I was seated
in my chair, with my eyes tightly shut, my hands gripping the arms of
the chair, doing all I could to concentrate my mind on Vincey, and then
I perceived myself outside my body--saw my body near me, but certainly
not containing me, with the hands relaxing and the head drooping forward
on the breast.”
Nothing shakes him in his assurance of that release. He describes in a
quiet, matter-of-fact way the sensation he experienced. He felt he
had become impalpable--so much that he had expected.
